In the endeavor of forecasting house prices within the scope of this project, we utilized a dataset titled "USA_HOUSING," encompassing information sourced from the United States. Our efforts were focused on the thorough analysis of this dataset, during which I employed advanced machine learning algorithms to conduct a comprehensive evaluation.

Importing required packages Our primary packages for this project are going to be pandas for data processing, NumPy to work with arrays, matplotlib & seaborn for data visualizations, and finally scikit-learn for building an evaluating our ML model.

Performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the housing price dataset, visualizing pertinent insights from the data, engaging in feature selection, partitioning the data, employing diverse algorithms to model the dataset, and subsequently gauging the efficacy of the constructed model through rigorous evaluation metrics.
